        <h3 class="page-title"><i>About</i></h3>
        <p>
            <b><i>Pender Guitar Studio</i></b> is a guitar & music lesson studio that is focused on helping all types of students connect with their unique inner musician — rooted in teacher guided goal setting & reflection.
            <br><br>
            Stu Pender is a guitarist from Chicago, who graduated from the Jazz Conservatory at SUNY Purchase, NY. Stu has worked with artists such as Photay, Elijah Wolf, Poetic Thrust, Topaz Jones, Allison Ponthier, Maggie Rogers, Los Lobos, and The Gipsy Kings; and he has performed at world class venues such as the Beacon Theatre, UN Assembly Hall, and MoMA PS1. Stu has studied with John Abercrombie, Jon Faddis, Vic Juris, Barry Harris, Fabiano do Nascimento, Derek Gripper, and Miguel Atwood-Ferguson--in the styles of blues, rock, classical, jazz, hip hop, Brazilian, and kora music of West Africa.
            <br><br>
            Stu brings this diversity of experience into his teaching of guitar and ukulele. He aims to meet each student as they are. He believes that by following a student’s natural interests, paired with a curriculum rooted in non-judgmental evaluation of ability, the student will be on the clearest path towards authentic expression. Through this process the student can make this world a more joyful place, one note at a time.

                Stu Pender is a guitarist and composer from the suburbs of Chicago, IL. After performing at a young age with blues rock band Los Lobos and later studying with ECM pioneer John Abercrombie, Stu settled in Brooklyn, NY where he’s performed or recorded with artists such as Photay, Elijah Wolf, Poetic Thrust, Maggie Rogers, Raphaelle, Kareem Ali, Yoh, Allison Ponthier, Topaz Jones, and the Gipsy Kings — at world class venues including the Beacon Theatre, United Nations Assembly Hall, MoMA PS1, Brooklyn Steel, and many more. <br><br>
                Stu has also written & performed music for advertisement & film, most recently playing guitar on the soundtrack of the Sundance Film Festival award-winning short film "Don't Go Tellin' Your Mama". <br><br>
                Stu continues his study in the traditions of Brazilian guitar & the Kora music of Mali. Working in a wide variety of styles has led him to carve out a sonic signature uniquely his own. His upcoming solo record <i>Stillness In Motion</i> will be released in early 2022 by Youngbloods Records.<br><br><br>

        <p>
            <b><i>Pender Guitar Studio</i></b> is a guitar & music lesson studio that is focused on helping all types of students connect with their unique inner musician — rooted in teacher guided goal setting & reflection.
            <br><br>
            Stu Pender is a guitarist from Chicago, who graduated from the Jazz Conservatory at SUNY Purchase, NY. Stu has worked with artists such as Photay, Elijah Wolf, Poetic Thrust, Topaz Jones, Allison Ponthier, Maggie Rogers, Los Lobos, and The Gipsy Kings; and he has performed at world class venues such as the Beacon Theatre, UN Assembly Hall, and MoMA PS1. Stu has studied with John Abercrombie, Jon Faddis, Vic Juris, Barry Harris, Fabiano do Nascimento, Derek Gripper, and Miguel Atwood-Ferguson — in the styles of blues, rock, classical, folk, jazz, hip hop, Brazilian guitar, and kora music of West Africa.
            <br><br>
            Stu brings this diversity of experience into his teaching of guitar and ukulele. He aims to meet each student as they are. He believes that by following a student’s natural interests, paired with a curriculum rooted in non-judgmental evaluation of ability, the student will be on the clearest path towards authentic expression. Through this process the student can make this world a more joyful place, one note at a time.

                    <li><i>"I had such a good experience taking guitar lessons with Stu. He was
                        awesome from day one. Not only did we learn some bucket list songs I've
                        always wanted to know, he gave me some etudes to work on which really
                        improved my guitar playing. We would then dissect the songs that we
                        learned in terms of chord progression and structure which helped my
                        songwriting immensely. In fact, it wasn't only his guitar lessons that
                        impressed me. His all-around knowledge of productions tools (Ableton,
                        etc.) along with his mixing skills helped me translate some of those song
                        ideas into finished products."</i> — John D.</li><br><br>
                    <li><i>"I really enjoyed working with Stu and would 100% recommend his
                        lessons to anyone looking to learn more about guitar and music theory. I
                        loved all the repertoire work and the exercises he put together, and felt
                        way more confident about my playing after we worked together. I also
                        learned about so many interesting artists and techniques that I still return
                        to."</i> — Sam B.</li><br><br>
                    <li><i>"Stu Pender is an awesome guitar teacher! I've learned a lot about music
                        theory and guitar technique from him, which has improved my playing
                        immensely. He's also very flexible which works with my busy schedule. I
                        highly recommend him if you're just starting to play or are more
                        advanced!"</i> — Jonathan B.</li><br><br>
                    <li><i>"Stu is a such a wonderful guitar teacher! His flexible approach to lessons
                        have made it easy to stay passionate about learning new things on the
                        guitar. My lessons with him have taught me more than just how to play
                        chords and scales-he's helped me truly understand the music I love on a
                        deeper level."</i> — Scott H.</li>
